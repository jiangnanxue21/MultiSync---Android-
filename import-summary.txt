ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* MultiSync for Android 类详细说明.docx
* MultiSync for Android使用说明.docx
* MultiSync类图.pdf
* MultiSync类图.vsd
* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets
* lib/ => app/src/main/java/
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/.DS_Store
* src/org/apache/commons/collections/bag/package.html => app/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/collections/bag/package.html
* src/org/apache/commons/collections/bidimap/package.html => app/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/collections/bidimap/package.html
* src/org/apache/commons/collections/buffer/package.html => app/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/collections/buffer/package.html
* src/org/apache/commons/collections/collection/package.html => app/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/collections/collection/package.html
* src/org/apache/commons/collections/comparators/package.html => app/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/collections/comparators/package.html
* src/org/apache/commons/collections/functors/package.html => app/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/collections/functors/package.html
* src/org/apache/commons/collections/iterators/package.html => app/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/collections/iterators/package.html
* src/org/apache/commons/collections/keyvalue/package.html => app/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/collections/keyvalue/package.html
* src/org/apache/commons/collections/list/package.html => app/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/collections/list/package.html
* src/org/apache/commons/collections/map/package.html => app/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/collections/map/package.html
* src/org/apache/commons/collections/overview.html => app/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/collections/overview.html
* src/org/apache/commons/collections/package.html => app/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/collections/package.html
* src/org/apache/commons/collections/set/package.html => app/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/collections/set/package.html

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
